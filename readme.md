# Deprecated

I feel like browser support for `position:sticky` is now good enough that I no longer plan to polyfill the feature my projects.  Feel free to use this, just know that I don't plan on reaching full compatibility with `position:sticky`.

## Summary

A `position: sticky` polyfill that's dependency-free and does not modify the DOM tree, i.e., React-friendly.  See [react-sticky-position](https://github.com/jackmoore/react-sticky-position) for the React component.

#### Demo

Todo

##### Install via NPM
```bash
npm install sticky-position
```
